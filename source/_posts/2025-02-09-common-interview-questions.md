如果还未辞去上一个工作、上班时间又太近，似乎有些强人所难，因为交接至少要一个月的时间，应进一步说明原因

# 关于离职动机的问题

## Why do you want to leave your current job ? 
I leave my position at Trend Micro because our R&D center is being relocated out of China.
我离职的原因是公司的研发中心正在撤离中国

This relocation is caused by geopolitical factors, such as tensions in China-US relations, national security regulations and customer concerns about data security.
公司撤离中国的主要原因是地缘政治因素，比如这几年中美关系紧张，国内安全法规的管制，客户对数据安全的担忧

I had to leave my job due to these external changes, and it's not related to my personal performance.
离职的原因是这些外部环境的变化，和我个人的工作表现没有关系

## Why do you want to leave your first job ? 
I chose to leave my first job at Huawei for two reasons.
选择离开华为主要有两大原因

Firstly, at Huawei, I felt like I was more of a cog in a machine. My job was mainly about sticking different components from other departments together. 
第一个原因，在华为工作我觉得自己就像一个螺丝钉。 比方说我们那个设备管理部门的主要业务, 做的最多一个东西就是胶水, 把别的部门组件粘在一起, 没有一个领域的概念

And I had limited opportunities to engage with customer needs or participate in design work. This made me concerned about my technical growth and career future.
而且在华为做2-3年开发, 很难接触到客户需求, 或者参与设计工作, 这些都是前线或者SE接触的。 如果继续在原部门做，自己的技术视野会变得非常窄, 这对于今后职业发展很不利

Secondly, there was a lot of overtime. During peak project times, I often had to work until 1 AM. It's difficult to achieve a good work-life balance.
第二个原因就是加班太多。 项目紧张的时候每天需要在公司干到凌晨1点钟，很难实现工作生活的一个平衡

So, even though I received a promotion at Huawei, I still decided to leave and seek new opportunities. 
所以，尽管我在华为有过升职和加薪，我当时还是决定跳槽换工作
