Hello, I'm very glad to join this interview today.

My name is Chuang Pan. I graduated from NanJing University in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science, and I have 5 years of experience in Linux software development.

My first job began at Huawei. As a software engineer, I was responsible for developing a board emulation platform based on Docker and Redis,
which helped developers perform software testing without physical devices. This not only improved development efficiency but also saved a lot of money for the company.

After that, I left Huawei and came to Trend Micro. I was responsible for the feature development of Service Gateway project.
This gateway is built on Microk8s and provides service for On-premises Trend products, reducing customer's bandwidth consumption

In this project, I implemented various optimization to enhance user experience. For example, I designed an upgrade solution for the service gateway that allows system upgrades without customers noticing 
In addition, I optimized the microservice integration by decoupling service images from virtual appliances, reducing upgrade time by 40%, which greatly improved user experience.

In my work, I have always focused on improving my problem-solving abilities. For example, I can use my network knowledge to quickly resolve customer cases.
I provided a solution for customers with firewall configuration problems, which greatly improved user experience.

I believe my skills and experience can align well with your team's needs. And I hope to join your company and grow with your team.

That's all about me, Thank you very much.

# 关于离职动机的问题

## **Why do you want to leave your current job (你为什么离职)**
I leave my position at Trend Micro because our R&D center is relocating out of China.
我离职的原因是公司的研发中心正在撤离中国

This relocation is caused by geopolitical factors, such as strained relation between China and US.
公司撤离中国的主要原因是地缘政治因素，比如中美关系紧张

I had to leave my job because of these external factors. It's not related to my personal performance, That's all.
离职的原因是这些外部因素

## **Why do you want to leave your first job (为什么第一份工作离职)**

(不要提加班太多)
I chose to leave my first job for two reasons. Firstly, at Huawei, I felt like I was more of a cog in a machine.
选择离开华为有两个原因。 第一个原因是，在华为工作我觉得自己就像一个螺丝钉

I had limited opportunities to engage with customer needs or participate in design work. This made me concerned about my technical growth and career future.
在华为做开发的时候, 很难接触到客户需求, 参与设计工作。 如果我继续留在华为，自己的技术视野会变得非常窄, 对于今后职业发展不利

Secondly, there was a lot of overtime. During peak project times, I often had to work until 1 AM. It's difficult for me to achieve a good work-life balance.
第二个原因就是加班太多。 项目紧张的时候每天需要在公司干到凌晨1点钟，很难实现工作生活的平衡

Although I received a promotion at Huawei, I still decided to leave and seek new opportunities. 
所以，尽管我在华为有过升职和加薪，我当时还是决定跳槽换工作

## **What do you think of the current layoffs (你怎么看待当下的裁员)**
Layoff is a common phenomenon today. First of all, we need to be optimistic and face challenges with courage.
裁员是一个很普遍的现象。 作为员工, 我们首先需要保持乐观的精神，勇于面对挑战

We need to realize that layoff is not a negative thing, and every change may bring new opportunities.
我们需要认识到, 裁员并不是一件完全负面的事情, 每一次的变化都可能带来新的机遇

And I think it's very important to learn new technologies continously and keep up with the times.
最重要的是不断提升自己的核心竞争力, 持续学习新技能, 跟上这个飞速变化的时代，努力让自己成为不可替代的人

## **How do you look at job-hopping (你对跳槽的看法)**
I think people change job just to seek better development, and it's not a problem.
正常的跳槽是为了寻求更好的个人发展机会, 没有什么不妥

But, I am against frequent job-hopping because it's harmful to both employees and the company.
但频繁跳槽对个人和企业都不利，这种跳槽我反对


# 关于工作经历的问题

## **What's your greatest achievement in your past work (过去工作中最大的成就是什么)**
[TODO]
我过去工作中最大的成就是, 在服务网关项目中, 设计并实现了一个虚拟设备固件的升级方案. 这个方案有两大挑战:
 
一个是没有先例可循; 公司内部没有部门实现过类似的方案, 当时也没有ChatGPT, 需要基于对技术原理的理解推导一个可行方案

另一个挑战是涉及技术复杂多样, 比如Linux知识, 包括启动流程, 分区管理, initrd定制, ISO定制, GRUB引导程序, 
以及K8S, Docker, HTTP, 消息队列, Python等, 需要整合这些技术实现了一个可靠的解决方案.

为了解决这些问题, 在设计阶段, 我积极和团队沟通, 明确升级方案的具体需求, 同时投入大量时间学习相关技术, 确保对升级流程有了清晰的认识

然后是模块化设计，把整个升级流程分为多个模块, 比如升级包制作模块, 在线升级模块, 定时任务模块, 每个模块专注于解决特定问题, 降低了开发难度, 提高可维护性

除了开发任务, 我还负责设备启动问题定位和网络问题定位, 能够快速响应并处理客户case. 解决问题能力也得到了提升

目前这套升级方案应用于6000多企业客户, 超过1万台虚拟设备运行。 我写的代码可以运行在世界各地的设备上, 这是一件有成就感的事

## **Talk about the most frustrating experience in your past work (谈谈你过去的工作经验中，最令你挫折的事情)**
OK, let me tell you a challenge I encountered in my project.
我举一个项目中遇到的挑战

In Service Gateway project, customers want to deploy Virtual Appliance on AWS, but AWS didn't support Rocky Linux OS.
在服务网关项目中，有些客户想把虚拟设备安装到AWS云上, 但是当时AWS并不支持RockyLinux的镜像.

I communicated with AWS technical support, but we were unable to find a solution.
我和AWS的技术支持沟通也没有解决办法.
After that, I kept trying to build images, but the problem remained unsolved for a week. 
之后我就不停尝试做镜像, 结果一个礼拜也没有解决 

I came up with a workaround until my leader approached me. Let customer install CentOS first, then upgrade online, this eventually resolved customer's problem. 
直到项目经理找到我沟通, 他一句话就解决了我的问题. 让客户安装CentOS, 再通过升级的方式完成安装, 终于解决了客户问题

This experience taught me that when facing problems, it's important to seek help from my team to avoid getting stuck in a dead end.
这次经历让我意识到, 面对问题要及时求助团队, 集思广益. 避免钻到死胡同里

## **What are the differences between working at Trend Micro and Huawei (你觉得在趋势科技和华为公司工作有什么不同)**
At Huawei, the work is highly specialized. Each developer only need to focus on his specific task, such as coding and testing.
在华为做研发工作, 分工非常细致。 每个人只需关注自己负责的一块就能把工作完成。

We had limited opportunities to engage with customer requirements or participate in design work. Because design work are handled by designers.
很少有机会接触到需求分析, 用户体验, 因为这些都是专门的设计人员负责 

But at Trend Micro, our team is quite small and only has 10 members.
但是在趋势科技工作, 我们团队规模比较小, 只有10人左右。 

Besides coding and testing, we also need to analyse customer's requirement, design system and handle customer's cases.
除了编码和测试之外, 我们还需要分析客户需求, 做系统设计, 处理客户问题 

And I think working at Trend Micro improved my skills in multiple areas.  
这种工作模式锻炼了我多方面的技能

## What were the best aspects of your last job (对于目前仍在职的工作，你最喜欢地方有哪些)
I like my current job because I can learn a lot of things.
我喜欢这份工作的地方, 可以学到很多新的东西

Besides coding and testing, I can also engage with customer requirements, participate in design work and handle customer's cases.
除了编码和测试, 我还能接触客户需求, 参与系统设计, 处理客户问题 

I think working at Trend Micro improved my skills in multiple areas.  
在趋势的工作锻炼了我多方面的技能

And I don't have too much overtime, it's easy for me to achieve a good work-life balance at Trend Micro.  
很少加班，容易实现工作和生活的平衡 

## Describe the employee you most enjoy working with (你喜欢和什么样的员工共事)
I enjoy working with straightforward people. It's comfortable to communicate with them. And good communication is vert important at work.

即使最后没有采用我的方案，我也会全力支持团队的决定

# 关于自我评价的问题
## **What are your strengths as an employee (作为一名公司员工, 你觉得自己有什么优点)**
I think my strength is the ability to learn quickly. For example, when I first took over the project, I wasn't familar with Kubernetes.
But I learned it very quickly and contributed to the project in a very short time.
快速学习能力. 比如我刚接手项目时, 不了解K8S; 但我在很短时间内, 通过自学快速上手项目.

Another strength is proactive thinking and optimization. For example, in the Service Gateway project, 
I optimized the upgrade solution for virtual appliance, which grealy improved user experience and development efficiency.
我的另一个优点是, 主动思考和优化项目的能力, 比如在服务网关项目中, 我优化了虚拟设备的升级方案, 从而提高了开发效率, 改善了用户体验.

This also enhanced my unstanding of the HTTP protocol.
还有问题定位的能力. 比如FPS项目中定位了一些客户网络不通的问题, 通过抓包分析, 加深了对HTTP协议的理解

## **What are your strengths as an employee (作为一名公司员工, 你觉得自己有什么缺点)**
[TODO]
在过去的工作中, 存在过于扣技术细节，忽略了从用户角度出发思考问题.

比如华为的Matrix仿真项目，我建议使用k8s管理容器, 被架构师反对. 他们指出项目的核心需求是, 让用户在自己开发机上快速地搭建环境
而k8s的复杂性和资源消耗, 并不符合用户真正需求. 这让我意识到，技术选型需要从用户出发, 不是单纯追求新技术

比如趋势的服务网关项目, 开发微服务的时候需要提供REST API. 我最初想用熟悉的Java实现, 
被同事指出Java过于重量级, 让我尝试Python, 最后快速实现了需求, 同时降低了维护成本

这些经验让我认识到, 技术选型需要以解决问题为核心，考虑用户体验、 开发效率、 维护成本，而不是盲目依赖已知技术或追逐新技术
