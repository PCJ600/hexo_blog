# 关于离职动机的问题

## Why do you want to leave your current job (你为什么离职)
I leave my position at Trend Micro because our R&D center is being relocated out of China.
我离职的原因是公司的研发中心正在撤离中国

This relocation is caused by geopolitical factors, such as tensions in China-US relations and customer concerns about their data security.
公司撤离中国的主要原因是地缘政治因素，比如这几年中美关系紧张，客户对数据安全的担忧

I had to leave my job due to these external changes, and it's not related to my personal performance.
离职的原因是这些外部环境的变化

## Why do you want to leave your first job (为什么第一份工作离职)
I chose to leave my first job at Huawei for two reasons. Firstly, at Huawei, I felt like I was more of a cog in a machine.
选择离开华为有两个原因。 第一个原因是，在华为工作我觉得自己就像一个螺丝钉

I had limited opportunities to engage with customer needs or participate in design work. This made me concerned about my technical growth and career future.
在华为做开发的时候, 很难接触到客户需求, 参与设计工作。 如果我继续留在华为，自己的技术视野会变得非常窄, 对于今后职业发展不利

Secondly, there was a lot of overtime. During peak project times, I often had to work until 1 AM. It's difficult to achieve a good work-life balance.
第二个原因就是加班太多。 项目紧张的时候每天需要在公司干到凌晨1点钟，很难实现工作生活的平衡

So, even though I received a promotion at Huawei, I still decided to leave and seek new opportunities. 
所以，尽管我在华为有过升职和加薪，我当时还是决定跳槽换工作

## How do you look at job-hopping (你对跳槽的看法)
I think people change job just to seek better development, and it's not a problem.
正常的跳槽是为了寻求更好的个人发展机会, 没有什么不妥

But,I am against frequent job-hopping. It's harmful to both employees and the company.
但频繁跳槽对个人和企业都不利，这种跳槽我反对


# 关于工作经历的问题

## What's your greatest achievement in your past work (过去工作中最大的成就是什么)
[TODO]

## Talk about the most frustrating experience in your past work (谈谈你过去的工作经验中，最令你挫折的事情)
我举一个项目中遇到的挑战
Let me give an example of a challenge I encountered in my project.

在服务网关项目中，客户想把虚拟设备安装到AWS云上, 但是AWS不支持Rocky的镜像, 导致客户需求无法满足.
In Service Gateway project, customers want to deploy Virtual Appliance on AWS, but AWS didn't support Rocky Linux OS.

我和AWS的技术支持多次沟通, 等了几天仍没有结果.
I communicated with AWS technical support, waited for several days. And this problem still not solved. 

直到领导找我沟通, 我才想到了一个变通方案: 让客户安装CentOS, 再通过在线升级的方式实现安装, 最后解决了客户问题
I came up with a workaround until my leader approached me. Let customer install CentOS first, then upgrade online, this eventually resolved customer's problem. 

这次经历让我意识到, 面对问题要积极沟通, 避免钻到死胡同里，要灵活寻找解决方案  
I realized that it's important to communicate with my leader or colleague in time when facing problems,
avoid getting stuck in a dead end, and learn to find solution flexibly.

## Would you briefly describe your company to me (请你简单介绍下前公司)
OK, Trend Micro was founded in 1988 in the US. Our company is a global leader in cybersecurity solutions.

我喜欢这份工作的地方, 可以学到很多新的东西

My team gave me high flexibility, I can participate in requirement design, not just coding.

但如果领导的方案存在问题, 我会通过摆数据, 做验证, 客观向领导反应问题, 让领导考虑我的方案. 

# 关于自我评价的问题

## What are your strengths as an employee (作为一名公司员工, 你觉得自己有什么优点)
I think my strength is the ability to learn quickly. For example, when I first joined project, I wasn't familar with Kubernetes.
But I learned very quickly and successfully contributed to our project.
快速学习能力. 比如我刚接手项目时, 不了解K8S; 但我在很短时间内, 通过自学快速上手项目.

Another strength is proactive thinking and optimization. For example, In the Service Gateway project, 
I optimized upgrade solution for Virtual appliance. which improved development efficiency and customer experience.
主动思考能力, 优化项目中的问题, 比如在服务网关项目中, 我优化了虚拟设备的升级方案, 提高了开发效率, 改善了用户体验. 

Finally, I'm glad to help colleagues. I am willing to provide answers when my colleagues face technical problems.
In addition, I wrote some documents and blogs to share knowledge and support the team. 
乐于帮助同事. 平时同事遇到技术问题, 我乐于解答; 此外, 在公司写文档和博客, 分享知识, 帮助团队.

## What are your strengths as an employee (你觉得自己有什么缺点)
在过去的工作中, 存在过于扣技术细节，忽略了从用户角度出发思考问题.

比如华为的Matrix仿真项目，我建议使用k8s管理容器, 被架构师反对. 他们指出项目的核心需求是, 让用户在自己开发机上快速地搭建环境
而k8s的复杂性和资源消耗, 并不符合用户真正需求. 这让我意识到，技术选型需要从用户出发, 不是单纯追求新技术

比如趋势的服务网关项目, 开发微服务的时候需要提供REST API. 我最初想用熟悉的Java实现, 
被同事指出Java过于重量级, 让我尝试Python, 最后快速实现了需求, 同时降低了维护成本

这些经验让我认识到, 技术选型需要以解决问题为核心，考虑用户体验、 开发效率、 维护成本，而不是盲目依赖已知技术或追逐新技术

# 请你提问
问开发
* 能分享一下您平时的工作内容, 会用到哪些技术栈
* 您觉得在这个职位表现出色的员工有哪些特点
* 像我们做技术的，是应该在具体的某一个领域钻的更深呢，还是应该更广泛的涉猎不同领域的技术知识？很多时候这两个目标是矛盾的。

* 目前团队正在处理哪些重点项目？这些项目中遇到的主要挑战是什么

问HR
* 能说明下贵公司的晋升机制吗
* 贵公司如何进行绩效考核的
* 贵公司最看重员工的哪些品质

# 其他问题

## 如果没有被录用，你咋办?
I will accept the reality, keep learning to enhance my skills, and try harder next time.
我会接受现实, 做面试复盘, 不断学习, 完善技能, 再接再厉
